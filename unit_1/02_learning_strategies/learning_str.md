# Module 2 |Strategies for Learning
* `OLI Statistics` is not your typical course. Our goal is for you to work through the course materials online on your own time and in the way that is most efficient given your prior knowledge.

* While you will have more flexibility than you do in a traditional course, you will also have more responsibility for your own learning. You will need to:

  * Plan how to work through each unit.
  * Determine how to use the various features of the course to help you learn.
  * Decide when you need to seek additional support.
### What You Need to Know about Each Unit
*  unit in this course has features designed to support you as an independent learner, including the following:

  * <font color='green'>Explanatory content</font>: The content is the informational “meat” of every chapter. It consists of short passages of text with information, examples, images and explanations.

  * <font color='green'>Learn By Doing activities</font>: Learn By Doing activities give you the chance to practice the concept that you are learning, with hints and feedback to guide you if you struggle.

  * <font color='green'>Did I Get This? activities</font>: Did I Get This? activities are your chance to do a quick self-check to assess your own understanding of the material before doing a graded activity.

  * <font color='green'>Many Students Wonder sidebars</font>: These short passages provide supplementary material that you may find interesting but that is not necessary to understand the main concepts presented in the course.

  * <font color='green'>Checkpoints</font>: Taking these short assessments will show your instructor how well you have understood the material.

  * <font color='green'>Lab exercises<font> Lab exercises, called StatTutors, occur at the end of some modules. In these labs, you will practice the process of a statistical investigation. You will investigate a research question using real data and technology. These labs provide the opportunity to integrate concepts from various modules.
