Module 1 |Welcome!
### Welcome to Probability and Statistics!

* We begin with a short section to prepare you for learning online. For some of you, this material may be part of a hybrid learning experience in which you also meet face-to-face with an instructor. Some of you may be taking this course solely online, with a lot, a little, or no interaction with an instructor. We discuss learning strategies for these different types of learning environments and give you some pointers for using this material to support your learning.

* We then discuss what statistics is all about—the "Big Picture" of statistics—and look at how the four steps in the `Big Picture connect` to the modules in the `Probability and Statistics course`.
